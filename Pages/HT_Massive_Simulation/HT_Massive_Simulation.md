# How to run a massive simulation to test and validate an ADAS

This guide will walk you through the Massive Simulation workflow in SCANeR:
* [Guide 1. Prepare SCANeR workspace on Windows](HT_Prepare_SCANeR_workspace_under_Windows.md)
* [Guide 2. Generate test cases on Windows](HT_Generate_test_cases.md)
* [Guide 3. Port SCANeR workspace on Linux](HT_Port_SCANeR_workspace_under_Linux.md)
* [Guide 4. Run test cases on Linux](HT_Validate_test_cases_under_Linux.md)
* [Guide 5. SCANeR Analytics](HT_Analytics.md)  

> Tip: Want to go further and run SCANeR within a container as Docker? Check out this link  
> * [Run SCANeR within Docker](HT_Docker_build_run.md)  

It requires
* [Foundation Pack](https://www.avsimulation.com/pack-foundation/)
* [AD/ADAS Pack](https://www.avsimulation.com/pack-ad-adas/)
* [Massive Simulation Pack](https://www.avsimulation.com/pack-massive-simulation/)

> **Tip:** If you do not have yet all of the above content, no worries ðŸ˜‰  
> You can get the SCANeR ready-to-use environment from our github space  
> For further information check out our [Samples-Pack README](https://github.com/AVSimulation/SCANeR-Samples-Pack/blob/2022/README.md)  
> For this guide we'll use `SAMPLE_COMPUTE_LOCAL` and `SAMPLE_COMPUTE_HPC` :thumbsup:

You will also need an HPC platform. For the exercise, a simple Linux computer is enough.

## Principle of operations

SCANeR compute is a SCANeR studio solver, it enables you to run SCANeR simulations on HPC (High Performance Computing) architecture.  
It is compatible with any HPC platform (e.g. Azure, AWS, Alibaba) and supports any container solution (e.g. Docker, Kubernetes).  
To generate known and unknown test cases, use SCANeR explore (it takes input from a SCANeR studio test case).
