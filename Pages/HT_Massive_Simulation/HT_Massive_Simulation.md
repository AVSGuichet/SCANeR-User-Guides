This Quick Starts will guide you to
* Step 1. Prepare SCANeR workspace under Windows
* Step 2. Generate test cases thanks to SCANeR studio, explore under Windows
* Step 3. Port SCANeR workspace under Linux
* Step 4. Run test cases thanks to SCANeR compute under Linux
* Step 5. SCANeR Analytics

## Principle of operations

<p align="center">![](./assets/SCANeRProducts1.png "SCANeR Products")</p>

SCANeR compute is SCANeR studio solver, it enables to run SCANeR simulation on HPC architecture.  
It is compatible with any HPC platform (e.g. Azure, AWS, Alibaba) and supports any container solutions (e.g. Docker, Kubernetes).  
To generate known and unknow test cases use SCANeR explore (it takes as an input a SCANeR studio test case).
