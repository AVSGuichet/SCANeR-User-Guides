>**Note:**
>In addition, you will also receive our `Samples Pack` which includes a ready to use set of demonstrations of SCANeR features.

#### Step 2. Receive a link to download the trial

1. Click on the `Start Simulator` button (double blue triangles) to launch all the previously selected modules

2. Verify the status of the modules thanks to symbol in the green circle next to the modules.

The correct status of the module should be `Loaded`

#### Step 3. Run the simulation
Click on the `Play Scenario` button (black triangle in a green circle) to launch the simulation

The correct status of the module should be `Running`  

>If you have set parameters in your scenario you can set the value of these parameters at the start of the simulation. Click on the grey triangle next to the `Play Scenario` button and choose `Play Scenario with Parameters`. Would you like to design parametric simulation? [How to?

#### Step 4. Stop the simulation
Click on the `Stop Simulation` button (black square in a red circle)

âš  This is the right way to stop the simulation, any others button should be used to stop the simulation. âš   
Pause the simulation is also possible, click on the `Pause Simulation` button while while the simulation is running ðŸ˜Š

#### Step 5. Stop modules
Click on the `Stop Simulator` button (white cross in a red circle)

This button close, and kill the SCANeR modules in a clean way. If you stop the simulation with this button inconsistencies can appear (e.g. at the reload of the next simulation).  
  
We rely on you to run your simulation as it should be ðŸ˜‰
