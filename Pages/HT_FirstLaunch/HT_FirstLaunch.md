Once launched, a window will appear asking you to select a configuration to begin.

In order not to modify the DEFAULT configuration, which will be used as a base and back-up for many future situations, you will have to create a new configuration.

### Step 2. Create a new configuration

A new configuration is a copy of an existing one. As explained before, the DEFAULT configuration is used as a basis for creating other configurations.

Here, your only choice will be the DEFAULT configuration. Click on "Next".

The path to the folder of your configuration will be found by default with the other folders of the other configurations. Click on "Next".
