# How to Install the Samples Pack.

The Sample Pack includes specific samples of SCANeR configuration, scenario and dependencies. Once loaded, the sample is *click to run*. In addition the sample manual explains exactly what happens during the scenario. It also explains how it was made, so you can quickly *understand*, and *make changes* to match your own application. The *source code* for API-based samples is included often using several of the programming languages.
