# How to Install the Samples Pack

The Sample Pack includes specific samples of SCANeR configurations, scenarios and dependencies. Once loaded, the sample is *click to run*. In addition the sample manual explains exactly what happens during the scenario. It also explains how it was made, so you can quickly *understand*, and *make changes* to suit your own application. The *source code* for API-based samples is included, often using several of the programming languages.

- The latest version of SCANeR studio

## Step 1. Prepare a folder

You can choose any folder for your SCANeR data and the Samples Pack.
> I like to use `D:/SCANeR_Data` for example.

For that, create the environment variable `LOCAL_STUDIO_PATH`.
* Open windows start menu.
* Find `Edit environment variables for your account`.
* Add variable `LOCAL_STUDIO_PATH`.
* Set the value as the path to your data folder.

## Step 4. Install

To finialize the installation, run the newly extracted `samples-pack-utils/updateConfigList.bat` by double-clicking on it.
> The script simply updates `%LOCAL_STUDIO_PATH%/configurations.cfg` with the Samples Pack configuration paths.

The documentation for the samples can be accessed from the [home page](../../index.md).
