# How to? Configure driver's input

SCANeR can be deployed on many different platforms (workstation, driving simulator, cloud, etc.). SCANeR can be used with autonomous driving as well as with a human driver in the loop. Having an accurate acquisition of the driver's input is very important in order to have a more immersive driving experience.


This guide explains how to configure driver's input in SCANeR studio.
- Step 1. Add the driver's acquisition module to your SCANeR workspace
- Step 2. Select the correct configuration file 
- Step 3. Modify the mapping 
  - Step 3.1 Steering wheel
  - Step 3.2 Pedals
  - Step 3.3 Gearbox

## Step 1 Add the driver's acquisition module to your SCANeR workspace
1.1 Open SCANeR studio on your system and go to `CONFIGURATION/Configuration Manager...`
1.2 It already contains ACQUISITION module, you can skip to step 1.4
1.3 Add the Acquisition module to your SCAneR Workspace
  1 Click on `Add Process`, select `DRIVERHANDLER` module from the `Process Editor` list, click on `Add` and `Close`

## Step 2 Driver acquisition configuration file 
We provide several driver acquisition configuration files. These are preconfigured in order to work with standard systems (Logitech, Fanatec, Sensodrive steering wheels, etc.). The user is able to use these configuration files and tune them to fits its need.
Click on file icon next to .hrdv file name -> Interface to change the mapping and gearbox modes, add additionnal hardware, tune the force feedback etc.

## Step 3 Modify the mapping

Congrats ! Have fun with your own steering wheel and pedals configuration !
