###### Step 2.3. Share it!
Once the C2V is generated, rename it (e.g. `Your_Company.C2V`) and send it to [support-scaner](mailto:support-scaner@avsimulation.fr).
AVSimulation will produce the license based on the collected information and send to you as
soon as possible the license file.

>**Note:**

##### Step 3. Install the license

Once you received the license file (V2C file), the last step is to [update the license](https://github.com/AVSGuillaume/Samples-Pack/blob/3182d60806769b3ba844f12e6597bad8b0606352/Pages/HT_Update_SCANeR_license/Update_SCANeR_license.md).
